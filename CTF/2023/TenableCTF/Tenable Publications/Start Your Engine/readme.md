There is nothing here, since the idea is about nessus publications we are trying to find the flag{ on the nessus blog and post

1. we try to search flag{ in the nessus blog and found this link first:

  https://www.tenable.com/blog/openai-chatgpt-and-gpt-4-used-as-lure-in-phishing-scams-to-promote-fake-token-airdrop

  the piece of flag will looks like this:
  ```<!-- flag{b10gs_ is incomplete. Proceed on great hunter. Get going, MOVE it -->```

2. since it's incomplete we are guessing that we should try to find the blog that having MOVE it as it's content, here is the link:
