`TL;DR Tenable CTF 2023 ITSEC ASIA Writeups`
--

Hello! Currently, we are playing in [ITSEC ASIA](https://itsec.asia/) (Indonesia) team in Tenable Nessus CTF 2023 and came up in 8th/1460+ teams.
Most of the teams are struggling to figure out what were the objectives of the two remaining last Cryptography and Steganography challenges since they are guessy in our opinion.
This repository is served for sharing thoughts and ideas on how we solve the challenges.

This year's CTF added a new category called `Tenable Publications` as an OSINT challenge related to Tenable itself.
